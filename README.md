### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Wanna learn more about me?
I don't know why you would but go a head and read below:


- I am currently working on no longer being sick. Have not had a voice for 3+ days.
- I am currently learning that I kinda like not speaking at all. Though its not a great long term strategy. 
- I am looking for help on any and all assignments that I struggle with.
- My Neat but Useless skill is being able to snap with all my fingers.
- I am just looking to get through this rough semester as painless as possible.
